<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New Features ‚ú®</h2>

1. Greatly improved the process of the manual testing application.
2. Created scene management system for the testing application.
   - Added a scene to test text rendering.
   - Added a scene to test mouse functionality.
   - Added a scene to test keyboard functionality.
   - Added a scene to test graphics rendering.
   - Created a simple scene management system to help easily add new scenes to the testing application.
3. Created new abstract control base class named _`Velaptor.UI.ControlBase`_ for the purpose of creating custom controls.
4. Created new _`Velaptor.UI.Label`_ control.
5. Created new _`Velaptor.UI.Button`_ control.
6. Created new _`Velaptor.UI.Textbox`_ control.
   - Warning!! - This control is not finished and needs some work.
7. Added ability to _`IContent`_ items to know if they have been created using **_Velaptor's_*** content pooling system.
   - This ability gives the user the ability to know if a content item was created and added to the pooling system vs. created as a custom instantiation by the user.
8. Added 2 new properties to the controls.
   - _`MouseHoverColor`_ - This is the color that is applied on top of the control during rendering when the mouse hovers over the control.
   - _`MouseDown`_ - This is the color that is applied on top of the control during rendering when the left mouse button is in the down position over a control.
9.  Added new boolean property named _`IsPooled`_ to the _`IContent`_ interface and all implementation members.
    - This property value is true if it was created using **_Velaptor's__** content creation system.
10. Created new exception type named _`PooledDisposalException`_.
   - This exception is thrown if an _`IContent`_ item is being disposed when it was created with **_Velaptor's_** content creation system which uses content pooling for performance.
   - NOTE: To know if an item was created in a pool, query the boolean value of the _`IContent.IsPooled`_ property.
11. Added ability to _`IContent`_ items to throw an exception of type _`PooledDisposalException`_.
12. Added ability for the content loaders below to take in a content name with or without and extension.
    - NOTE: If a content name contains an extension, it is ignored.
    - _`AtlasLoader`_
    - _`FontLoader`_
    - _`TextureLoader`_
    - _`SoundLoader`_ - This loader has not been updated to do this.  There are plans to make some changes to the _`ISound`_ type in **_Velaptor_** which will possibly require some changes to the **_CASL_** library.  Coming soon!!

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Bug Fixes üêõ</h2>

1. Fixed a bug with the _`MapValue`_ extension method.
2. Fixed a bug where clearing the screen to a set color was not working.
   - This was a bug with the _`ISpriteBatch.Clear()`_ method implementation.
3. Fixed a bug where in rare cases, the mouse setup process would try to duplicate setup of the mouse buttons causing an exception.
   - This issue may not have occurred, but was discovered during unit testing.
4. Fixed some bugs with how _`IContent`_ items were being disposed in UI controls and scenes.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Nuget/Library Additions üì¶</h2>

1. Added nuget package **_Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers v5.0.3_**
   - This is for the purpose for code analysis during development.
2. Added nuget package **_StyleCop.Analyzers v1.1.118_**
   - This is for the purpose for code analysis during development.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Breaking Changes üß®</h2>

1. Removed the following classes/types:
   - _`RenderText`_
   - _`UIText`_
2. Refactored any public members in the code base that ended with **_ID_** to end with **_Id_** instead.
   - This was to maintain consist clean code throughout the code base.
3. Changed the constructor of the _`Velaptor.UI.Window`_ class from **_public_** to **_protected_**.
4. Moved the types below from the _`Velaptor.Graphics`_ namespace to the _`Velaptor.Content`_ namespace:
   - _`IAtlasData`_
   - _`AtlasData`_
   - _`IFont`_
   - _`Font`_
   - _`ITexture`_
   - _`Texture`_
5. Changed the classes below to be sealed:
   - NOTE: This was done to make sure new types do not inherit from these lower level library types.  This is to make sure that the content pooling and **_OpenGL_** calls do not put the system into a state of being unstable.  If the user wants to create custom controls and content types, take advantage of all the interfaces. 
   - _`AtlasData`_
   - _`AtlasLoader`_
   - _`ContentLoader`_
   - _`Font`_
   - _`FontLoader`_
   - _`Sound`_
   - _`SoundLoader`_
   - _`Texture`_
   - _`TextureLoader`_
   - _`Button`_
   - _`Label`_
