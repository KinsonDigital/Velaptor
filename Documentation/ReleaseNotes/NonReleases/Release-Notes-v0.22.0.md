   * <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>CreateSoundLoader()</span>
2. <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>ContentSource </span> types are now called <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>Resolvers </span> and have been improved.  The following resolvers have been created to help resolve paths to various pieces of content

   * <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>SoundPathResolver</span>

5. Created a <span style='font-weight: bold; color: khaki'>PathResolverFactory </span> class to create instances of the different resolvers
6. Created new types for loading texture atlas data such as texture atlas images and atlas sub texture data
   * Created the following types to be used for loading of texture atlas's
