2. Got the **Mouse** functionality working.  Now the mouse can be used!!

### **Changes**

1. Removed old **SDL** related code from library/project/solution
2. Refactored code to prevent **OpenGL** related code from being exposed to the public API of the Velaptor library
3. Refactored code to use unsigned integers instead of signed integers where it makes sense
   * Example: You cannot have a texture with a negative width.  This has been converted to an unsigned integer
4. Created unit tests where applicable
