<h1 align="center">Branching</h1>

**Velaptor** uses a more complicated branching model, but it gives you more control of the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).  This branching model allows for a clear purpose for adding features, bug fixes, preview releases, qa releases and standard releases.

As a standard contributor though, all you have to worry about is simply creating <span style="color: #66B2FF;font-weight:bold">feature</span> branches and creating pull requests to merge those branches into the <span style="color: #FFB366;font-weight:bold">develop</span> branch.  The rest is taken care of by a solid CI/CD system as well as the maintainers of the project.  Only the organization owner and designated team members will manage the release process.  So contributing is very easy!!ðŸ¥³

**_NOTE_:** Like everything in software, everything is subject to change, including the branching model.  If too many issues or complications occur with the current branching model and/or release process, it will be changed accordingly.

- **Created From:** none
- **Merges Into:** none
- **Environment:** production
- **CI/CD:**
  - Upon pull request completion, the <span style="color: #00CCCC;font-weight:bold">release</span> branches are merged into the <span style="color: #82B366;font-weight:bold">master</span> branch and branch is automatically built, tested, and released to production as a nuget package.
  - The testing application is attached as an artifact to the <span style="color: #00CCCC;font-weight:bold">release</span> for the purpose of testing.

This branch is where urgent bug fixes or changes will be performed:

**_NOTE_:** This should be carefully reviewed and only done when something with the software is considered **broken** and/or **unusable**.  Changes to this branch should be absolutely minimal to achieve the required change.  Changes to this branch should be merged directly into the <span style="color: #82B366;font-weight:bold">master</span> branch via a pull request.

  - Upon merging into the <span style="color: #82B366;font-weight:bold">master</span> (Production) branch, a production will be automatically performed.


<h3 align="left" style="color: #CC99FF;font-weight:bold">Preview Branches</h3>

Holds minimal changes for the purpose of making an upcoming production release more stable.

**_NOTE_:** This is for such things as refactoring, bug fixes, and changes related to serving the main purpose of making an upcoming release more stable and to give users the chance to utilize the software before a major release.  Changes such as introducing major features outside of the changes in the upcoming release are not allowed.  This gives the chance for users to use the software and give feedback about any major issues before a stable production release is performed.  These kinds of changes are not performed on the <span style="color: #CC99FF;font-weight:bold">preview</span> directly but done by using <span style="color: #9E269E;font-weight:bold">preview feature</span> branches.
- **Branch Syntax:** preview/v\<major\>.\<minor\>.\<patch\>-preview.\<prev number\>
  - Example: preview/v1.2.3-preview.4
- **Branches That Can Merge Into Preview Branches:** <span style="color: #9E269E;font-weight:bold">preview feature</span> branches
- **Created From:** <span style="color: #00CCCC;font-weight:bold">release</span> branches
- **Merged Into:** <span style="color: #00CCCC;font-weight:bold">release</span> branches
- **Environment:** none
- **CI/CD:**
  - The major, minor, and patch numbers of the preview branch must match the numbers of the <span style="color: #00CCCC;font-weight:bold">release</span> branch that it was created from.
  - Build, unit test, and version validation status checks are automatically ran for each change to the pull request.
  - All status checks must pass for a pull request to be completed.
