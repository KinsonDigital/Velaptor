<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New Features ‚ú®</h2>

1. Added exception named `LoadTextureException` that will be thrown if something goes wrong when attempting to load textures.
2. Added exception named `LoadAtlasException` that will be thrown if something goes wrong when attempting to load texture atlas data.
3. Added exception named `CachingException` that will be thrown if something goes wrong when caching items during the content loading process.
4. Added exception named `LoadEmbeddedResourceException` that will be thrown if something goes wrong when loading embedded resources during the content loading process.
5. Added exception named `CachingMetaDataException` that will be thrown if something goes wrong when processing metadata during the font loading process.
6. Added a property named `AtlasDataFilePath` to the `AtlasData` class and `IAtlasData` interface.
   - This is the fully qualified file path to an atlas texture **JSON** data file.
7. Added the ability to automatically create default white pixels for the `ImageData` struct constructor when using `null` for the `pixels` parameter.
8. Enhanced the caching system to improve performance, code maintainability, and testability.
9. Added an `IItemCache` interface that can be used to build caching systems for personal application use.
    - For more information on how caching can be done, refer to [System.Collections.Concurrent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent?view=net-6.0) and  
      [System.Runtime.Caching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.caching?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0).
10. Added an `IDisposableItemCache` interface that inherits the new `IItemCache` interface to provide a way to dispose of cached items.
11. Added the ability to use a default font when creating UI controls to prevent the user from having to manage content items when dealing with `Label`  
    controls.  It also applies to any controls that render textual content.
12. Added the ability to load system fonts when loading an `IFont` content type.
    - Use the name of the content file with or without the extension to load this on purpose.
13. Added the ability to automatically search and load a system font that matches the requested font to be used if it does not exist in the  
    application's content directory.
14. Added enumeration named `FontSource` in the `Velaptor.Content.Fonts` namespace that is used to signify whether a font was  
    loaded from the application's content directory or from the current platform system fonts.
15. Added the properties below to the `IPlatform` interface and `Platform` class to check if the current platform is running as a 64-bit or 32-bit process.
    - `Is64BitProcess`
    - `Is32BitProcess`
16. Added extension methods below to help develop applications.
    - `IsLetter()` - Checks to see whether or not a character is a letter.
    - `IsNotLetter()` - Checks to see whether or not a character is not a letter.
    - `HasValidFullFilePathSyntax()` - Checks to see whether or not a string is a valid fully qualified file path from a syntax perspective.
    - `HasInvalidFullFilePathSyntax()` - Checks to see whether or not a string is an invalid fully qualified file path from a syntax perspective.
    - `HasValidDriveSyntax()` - Checks to see whether or not a string contains valid syntax for a drive from a syntax perspective.
    - `HasValidFullDirPathSyntax()` - Checks to see whether or not a string is a fully qualified directory path from a syntax perspective.
    - `HasValidUNCPathSyntax()` - Checks to see whether or not a string is a valid UNC path from a syntax perspective.
17. Created an interface and class implementation to abstract the process of serializing JSON data.
    - This is to help provide an easy, testable way to manage JSON data used in games and multimedia applications. 
    - `IJSONService`
    - `JSONService`
18. Added ability for the `SpriteBatch` class to throw an exception if attempting to render a texture or font.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Breaking Changes üß®</h2>

1. Changed the data type of the _`Width`_ and _`Height`_ properties from _`int`_ to _`uint`_ for both the _`IAtlasData`_ interface and _`AtlasData`_ class.
2. Moved the `FontStyle` enumeration to a new namespace named `Velaptor/Content/Fonts`.
3. Moved the `Font` class to a new namespace named `Velaptor/Content/Fonts`.
4. Moved the `IFont` class to a new namespace named `Velaptor/Content/Fonts`.
5. Moved the `Font` class to a new namespace named `Velaptor/Content/Fonts`.
6. Moved the `FontLoader` class to a new namespace named `Velaptor/Content/Fonts`.
7. Moved the `FontPathResolver` class to a new namespace named `Velaptor/Content/Fonts`.
8. Removed the `UnknownContentException` class.
9. Removed the `StringNullOrEmptyException` class.
10. Removed the `ContentType` enumeration.
11. Removed the `TextureType` enumeration.
12. Removed the `TextureCreationSource` enumeration.
13. Refactored `IContent` interface property `Path` to `FilePath` to better describe what kind of path it is.
    - This effects the `IContent` types below:
      - `AtlasData`
      - `Texture`
      - `Font`
      - `Sound`
14. Made API changes to the `IContentLoader` and `ContentLoader` types.  This was done due to extra font features needing more control over the font loading process.  This lead to using generics causing some issues with needing that finer control. 
    - Removed methods `Load<T>()` and `Unload<T>` and replaced them with respective methods to load each type of content.
    - Added the methods to load the respective types of content below:
      - `LoadTexture()`
      - `LoadSound()`
      - `LoadAtlas()`
      - `LoadFont`
    - Added the methods to unload the respective types of content below:
      - `UnloadTexture()`
      - `UnloadSound()`
      - `UnloadAtlas()`
      - `UnloadFont`
15. Refactored the parameter name of the `ILoader.Load()` and `ILoader.Unload()` methods from `name` to `contentPathOrName`.
16. Changed the `ShaderProgram` type from `public` to `internal`.
    - These types are not meant to be part of the public-facing API.
17. Changed the `GPUBufferBase<TData>` type from `public` to `internal`.
    - These types are not meant to be part of the public-facing API.
18. Changed all of the resolve types below from `public` to `internal`.
    - These types are not meant to be part of the public-facing API:
      - `ContentPathResolver`
      - `FontPathResolver`
      - `ContentFontPathResolver`
      - `WindowsFontPathResolver`
      - `SoundPathResolver`
      - `TexturePathResolver`
      - `AtlasJSONDataPathResolver`
      - `AtlasTexturePathResolver`
19. Changed the type `ISoundFactory` interface and `SoundFactory` class from `public` to `internal`.
    - These types were not meant to be part of the public-facing API.
20. Changed the read-only struct `ImageData` constructor parameter `pixels` from non-nullable to nullable. 
21. Changed the scope of the `Window.Dispose(bool disposing)` method from `protected` to `private`.
22. Removed the `IContent.IsPooled` property.  This property does not suit its purpose or intent anymore due to the improvements in the content caching system.
    - Removed the other implementations of the `IsPooled` property for the other `IContent` implementation classes.  All other references and related code were also cleaned up and removed.
      - `ITexture` interface and `Texture` class.
      - `ISound` interface and `Sound` class.
      - `IAtlasData` interface and `AtlasData` class.
      - `IFont` interface and `Font` class.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Other ü™ß</h2>
<h5 align="center">(Includes anything that does not fit into the categories above)</h5>

1. Changed the `Label` class to use the newly implemented default font system as a default font.
2. Improved how content is managed increasing testability, stability, and performance.
3. Lots of improvements to documentation related to grammar, spelling, and clarity.
    - This is all due to the hard work of my beautiful wife [@kselena](https://github.com/kselena/kselena)!!  Thanks babe!! üòö
