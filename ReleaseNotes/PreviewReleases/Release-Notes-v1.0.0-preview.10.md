<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Bug Fixes üêõ</h2>

1. [#382](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/382) - Fixed a bug where various file and directory path processing and new line characters were only working when running on **Windows**.
   - This change made the entire application more cross-platform.
2. [#385](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/385) - Fixed a bug with resolving paths when loading any type of content.
   - This bug was introduced when implementing issue [#382](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/382).

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Breaking Changes üß®</h2>

1. [#344](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/344) - Updated the projects to build and run for **_x64_(64 bit)** bit machines.
   - This was done due to the number of people running **_x86(32bit)_** machines.  Running this kind of architecture is getting rare and the work involved with supporting both is simply not worth the effort.
   - Updated all workflows to build and execute unit tests for the **_x64_(64 bit)** architecture.
   - Created publish profiles for **Windows** and **Linux** for each build configuration to assist with future cross-platform testing.
   - Configured the debugging console to display both **Debug**** and **Release** modes when using the **Velaptor Testing** application.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Internal Changes ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>
<h5 align="center">(Changes that do not affect users.  Not breaking changes, new features, or bug fixes.)</h5>

1. [#339](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/339) - Fixed an issue in the **_triage-issue_** workflow where the incorrect label was added to the issue.
2. [#342](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/342) - Upgraded to the new build system for the organization named [CICD](https://github.com/CICD).
   - This is the new build system for all of the C#/dotnet projects in the [KinsonDigital](https://github.com/KinsonDigital) organization.
   - This upgrade/change of the build system made the work for issue [#259](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/259) pointless due to this issue being implemented before the new build system was implemented.

     - The reason for the downgrade is not known and was unintentional.  The downgrade is safe due to this only being a patch change and testing was performed.  An upgrade is planned using version [#389](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Velaptor/issues/389).
